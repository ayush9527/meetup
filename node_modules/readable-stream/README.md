This package is a mirror of the streams implementations in Node.js.

Full documentation may be found on the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.19.0/docs/api/stream.html).

If you want to guarantee a stable streams base, regardless of what version of
Node you, or the users of your libraries are using, use **readable-stream** *only* and avoid the *"stream"* module in Node-core, for background see [this blogpost](http://r.va.gg/2014/06/why-i-dont-use-nodes-core-stream-module.html).

As of version 2.0.0 **readable-stream** uses semantic versioning.

## Version 3.x.x

v3.x.x of `readable-stream` is a cut from Node 10. This version supports Node 6, 8, and 10, as well as evergreen browsers, IE 11 and latest Safari. The breaking changes introduced by v3 are composed by the combined breaking changes in [Node v9](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v9.0.0/) and [Node v10](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v10.0.0/), as follows:
